# Sunshower.io Mark Usage

Use `mark.png` or `mark.svg` for all cases except for when there is not sufficient contrast between the colors of the mark and the background (e.g. against certain dark backgrounds).
In that case, use `mark-white.png` or `mark-white.svg`.
The mark's aspect ratio should never be altered.
